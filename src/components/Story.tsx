        <h1>Story</h1>
        <p>In the vast expanse of The Rift where time and space converge, the vessel came into existence, created by the Time Keeper. The vessel is born empty, void of experiences and knowledge, with the singular purpose of harnessing the control of time to put an end to a great and malevolent foe set on the destruction of the universe itself.</p>
        <p>The Time Keeper, a being residing outside of The Rift, guides the vessel on this perilous journey. A mysterious entity, the Time Keeper possessed knowledge beyond comprehension but was bound by a cosmic law that forbade direct interaction or interference with the world. Instead, the Time Keeper could only act through the vessel.</p>
        <p>It is the purpose of the vessel to gain the powers to manipulate time, uncover the identity of the one responsible for the degradation of the world, and ultimately put an end to their plans. To achieve this, the vessel must embark on a journey through the endless dimensions and worlds that lay beyond The Rift.</p>
        <p>As the vessel explores the multiverse, encounters with a multitude of beings native to the various realms are sure to happen. Some will be benevolent, seeking guidance and assistance, while others may be treacherous and pose threats of their own accord. With each encounter, the vessel must use their growing understanding of time to aid those in need, forging alliances and accumulating fragments of knowledge that would bring them closer to their ultimate goal.</p>
